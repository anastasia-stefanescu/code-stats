For local testing:
    Get pods:
        kubectl get pods -l app=cassandra
        ex: cassandra-0    1/1     Running   0          5m
    
    Forward your local port 9042 (or any free port you choose) to the Cassandra pod’s port 9042:
    This command keeps running in your terminal. As long as it’s active, connections to localhost:9042 on your machine are forwarded to cassandra-0 in the cluster.
        kubectl port-forward cassandra-0 9042:9042

    Connect Using cqlsh
        cqlsh 127.0.0.1 9042

    Note: Port-forwarding is ephemeral; once you close the kubectl port-forward session, 
          the connection from your local machine will drop. 
          
Cloud testing:      
    Expose Cassandra as a LoadBalancer or NodePort Service

    kubectl get svc cassandra-service -> this should show both external ip and cluster ip
        NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)    AGE
        cassandra-service   LoadBalancer   10.0.168.171   20.x.x.x       9042:NNNN  1m

    Connect Using cqlsh
        cqlsh 20.x.x.x 9042

Create tables through external ip?
