It seems the AWS CLI is not installed on your Mac M1. Follow these steps to install and configure it:

Step 1: Install AWS CLI on Mac M1
Download the AWS CLI Installer for Mac: Run the following command in your terminal to download the installer:

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
Install the Package: Use the installer command to install the AWS CLI package:

sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
Verify the Installation: Check the installed version of AWS CLI:

aws --version
You should see output like:

aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x.x Darwin/x86_64 (or arm64 for M1/M2)


If you are running the code locally, you need to configure your AWS credentials.

Run the following AWS CLI command to set up credentials:

aws configure

It will prompt you for:

AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Default region name
These credentials are stored in the ~/.aws/credentials file.
