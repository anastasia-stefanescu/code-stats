git clone https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-micro-examples.git

cd snowplow-micro-examples

docker-compose up
->This will:

    Start serving the app on localhost:8000
    Launch Snowplow Micro, mounting the micro directory and setting the port 9090 for accessing Micro's REST API endpoints. Inside the micro directory are:
    The configuration for Snowplow Micro.
    The configuration for Iglu resolvers.
    The iglu-client-embedded directory containing the custom schemas used for tracking.

npm install -> This step will install Nightwatch and Cypress.

To run all tests: We will be testing that tracking is properly configured on our site.
npm test
npm run test:nightwatch
npm run cypress:run
npm run cypress:open

Inside the .github/workflows/ directory you can find the .yml files we use to test this exaple app with Micro and Nightwatch/Cypress. A general workflow file would definitely use the Snowplow Micro step, which for our example is:

- name: Start Micro
    run: docker-compose up -d
    working-directory: snowplow-micro-examples
