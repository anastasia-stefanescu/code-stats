Snowplow Micro is a very small version of a full Snowplow data collection pipeline that can be embedded in automated test suites 
and so enable Snowplow users to test their data collection setup and then release new versions of their apps, websites and servers with confidence 
that new changes wonâ€™t break the tracking set up. 

Snowplow Micro comes to fill a missing piece in automated test suites: the tests that validate that data collection has been setup properly.

To check data collection, it is necessary to fire a set of events, process them and see if the output of that processing is as expected. 
Snowplow Micro is easy to integrate with your test tool and then run as part of your automated testing workflow. 
This repository aims to show in detail all the steps to do this using Nightwatch and Cypress as examples of test tools, to build end-to-end GitHub Actions testing workflows.

https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/data-product-studio/data-quality/snowplow-micro/basic-usage/

git clone https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-micro-examples.git

cd snowplow-micro-examples

docker-compose up
->This will:

    Start serving the app on localhost:8000
    Launch Snowplow Micro, mounting the micro directory and setting the port 9090 for accessing Micro's REST API endpoints. Inside the micro directory are:
    The configuration for Snowplow Micro.
    The configuration for Iglu resolvers.
    The iglu-client-embedded directory containing the custom schemas used for tracking.

npm install -> This step will install Nightwatch and Cypress.

To run all tests: We will be testing that tracking is properly configured on our site.
npm test
npm run test:nightwatch
npm run cypress:run
npm run cypress:open

Inside the .github/workflows/ directory you can find the .yml files we use to test this exaple app with Micro and Nightwatch/Cypress. A general workflow file would definitely use the Snowplow Micro step, which for our example is:

- name: Start Micro
    run: docker-compose up -d
    working-directory: snowplow-micro-examples
