Using multiple Emitters
    In case you want to send the events to multiple Snowplow collectors, you can provide a list of emitter configurations in the newTracker call â€“ one for each collector. This may look as follows.

Create your own Emitter
    Emitter is an object responsible for queuing tracked events and making requests to the Snowplow collector.

    By default, the Node tracker makes use of the fetch API to make the HTTP requests. If you want to use a different library or logic for queuing and sending events, you can provide a custom Emitter implementation.

    Emitters must conform to an Emitter interface, which looks like: ....


Verifying Events Are Sent to Snowplow

    Open VSCode in Debug Mode (F5).
    Perform tracked actions (open files, move the cursor, start debugging, etc.).
    Open Developer Tools (Help > Toggle Developer Tools) and check the Network tab for requests to https://collector.mydomain.net.
    If you're using Snowplow Micro, check logs:
        docker run -p 9090:9090 snowplow/snowplow-micro:latest
