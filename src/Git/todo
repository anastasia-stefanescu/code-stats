See:
src/repo/gitUtil -> why would we need these functions?
    accumulateNumStatChanges

    getInfoForCommit

    authors


TrackerManager
KpmManager

*Git actions weâ€™re interested in: commits
 - when committing (user-written code), we have to add to the team centralized pool of data how much he has added/deleted and when
 - see if commits are deleted (or fetch directly data from pushes??) -
Also check remote changes?
- branch create/delete
- merge branches


Why do we track remote changes?

Branches would be actually useful for project stats
